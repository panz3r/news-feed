  <p id="YEEjEm"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/28/3270259/teenage-engineering-op-1-accessories-launch-profile">Teenage Engineering’s OP-1</a> has one of the most iconic synthesizers around since it was first released over a decade ago, but the music-making machine is still getting new features: the company just announced its 243rd firmware update that adds USB audio support to the OP-1 for the first time. </p>
<p id="0VzU4P">The added feature turns the OP-1 into a full-fledged external audio unit. That means you can directly send audio from an OP-1 to DAW software like Ableton Live, Pro Tools, or Logic Pro on a PC or Mac or mobile versions of those applications on iOS and Android (like Garageband) without having to use any workarounds or hacks. Additionally, you’ll be able to sample and record on the OP-1 directly from a connected USB audio device. </p>
