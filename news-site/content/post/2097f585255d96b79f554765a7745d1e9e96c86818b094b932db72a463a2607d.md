  <p id="TyGLdg">Samsung recently launched a web version of its free and ad-supported Smart TV Plus streaming service for live and linear programming as well as added casting support for Chromecast devices.</p>
<p id="wEMhCm">The streaming product, which was previously limited to Samsung TV and mobile devices, launched as a web service in the second quarter, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/samsung-tv-plus-web-chromecast">Protocol reported</a> Friday. Itâ€™s a curious new player in the streaming wars and launched with seemingly little fanfare, but the rollout makes an app that was previously limited to Samsung users now widely available to just about anyone. </p>
<p id="0QSrfb">Samsung did not have immediate comment about the launch when reached on Friday. However, a spokesperson confirmed the launch of the web version of the service to Protocol. </p>
