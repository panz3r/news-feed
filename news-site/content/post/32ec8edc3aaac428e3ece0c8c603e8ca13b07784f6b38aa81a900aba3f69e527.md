  <p id="YJ9iXn">If you’re just starting to explore TikTok and you want to do a live video (as opposed to the usual recorded TikTok video), I’m afraid I have some bad news for you.</p>
<p id="KSmOSp">You can’t — at least, not yet.</p>
<p id="qjdXmm">Unlike Facebook / Instagram, which let anyone create a live video, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/foundations-for-success/going-live/">TikTok only makes live videos available</a> if you’re 16 years old or older and have more than 1,000 followers. Once you qualify, though, it’s a relatively simple process. </p>
<p id="oeLidK">But before we go into making a live broadcast, here’s a quick tip on how to find one. Note that, at present, you can only see live feeds from people you are following, so if you are really into live broadcasts, the best thing to do is follow a bunch of people. </p>
