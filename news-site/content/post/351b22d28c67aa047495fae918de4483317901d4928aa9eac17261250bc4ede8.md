  <p id="Dj1Cqq">After many teases, it seems as if a Samsung foldable is finally going to get support for an S Pen stylus. <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=PQFsmd5Fd6mroqLRXdITpA%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=A3LEJP5450">FCC filings for the S Pen Pro</a>, a bigger version of the S Pen with Bluetooth connectivity that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event">Samsung announced in January</a>, have been made public, and <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5331981">one document (PDF)</a> reveals that the upcoming stylus will work with the unannounced Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which is presumably the next device in the Z Fold lineup). </p>
