  <p id="3hwA3y">Facebook’s Portal video calling device is getting a <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> crossover that lets you and up to three friends dress up as characters from the play using augmented reality technology.</p>
<p id="N3GHvH">Here’s how you can use it, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-takes-center-stage-on-portal-with-curtain-call-ar-experience-plus-new-story-time-content/">according to a Facebook blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="Lv7bye">Anyone can initiate the experience by tapping “Curtain Call” in the effects tray on Portal. You can then select one of three locations from the menu to visit: Hogwarts Great Hall, the Ministry of Magic or the Edge of the Forbidden Forest. When the lights come up, each person on the call will embody a character from the show with a unique spell, which is assigned randomly. Simply nod your head or tap the screen to cast it and watch as your friends marvel at the magic.</p></blockquote>
