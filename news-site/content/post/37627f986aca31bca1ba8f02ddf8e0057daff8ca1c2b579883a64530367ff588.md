  <p id="ydNthB">Twitter says it has permanently suspended a “small number” of fake accounts it mistakenly verified just weeks after re-launching its public verification program, the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/twitter-verified-bot-accounts/"><em>Daily Dot</em> reports</a>. The blunder came to light after data scientist Conspirador Norteño <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475519609999366">discovered six verified accounts</a> which had been created recently on June 16th. None of them had posted a single tweet, and two used what appeared to be stock photographs for profile pictures. </p>
<p id="i3XAES">“We mistakenly approved the verification applications of a small number of inauthentic (fake) accounts,” Twitter told the <em>Daily Dot</em> in a statement. “We have now permanently suspended the accounts in question, and removed their verified badge, under our platform manipulation and spam policy.”</p>
