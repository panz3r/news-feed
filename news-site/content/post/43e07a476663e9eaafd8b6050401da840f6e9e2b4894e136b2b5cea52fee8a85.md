I was fine, but my watch’s glass face met an underwater rock, and uhhh… <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/352">it did not survive</a>.</p>
<p>When I got home, I grabbed my Series 5 off the shelf, knowing I didn’t have time to deal with having my Series 6 repaired and didn’t want to be without an Apple Watch, as I’ve recently begun using the watch in a major way after we spent some time apart.</p>
