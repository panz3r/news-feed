  <p id="7mXjnd">Nintendo finally announced the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price">Switch with an OLED screen</a> that comes out in October, but right now, GameStop is hosting a big one-day discount on two must-have Switch games: <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fsuper-mario-odyssey%2F10141908.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%2F10173345.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a>. Each game is going for $35 (usually $60) for the physical or digital versions, and if you have the means, I suggest getting both. <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> is the latest (delightful) installment in the long-running <em>Mario </em>3D platforming franchise, while <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> has strategic, turn-based battles interspersed with team- and friend-building elements you’d usually find in a <em>Persona </em>game.</p>
