  <p id="fmaqzO">We might now know a lot of what’s coming at Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked event thanks to a series of tweets from noted leaker Evan Blass. It seems like the event could be a big one, as Blass tweeted a long thread with GIFs of two new Galaxy foldables, a new Galaxy FE phone, two new Galaxy Watches, and even a set of new Galaxy Buds. He also says the event is set to take place <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423">one month from now on August 11th</a>.</p>
<p id="gLqej9">First up, the foldables. Blass has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable">already leaked</a> what appear to be official renders of the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which could support the S Pen stylus) and Galaxy Z Flip 3, but the new GIFs he shared give looks at both devices at all angles. </p>
<p id="MLbvNC">Here’s the Z Fold 3, which Blass shared GIFs of in <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734357328699396">white</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353">green</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734378996371456">black</a>:</p>
