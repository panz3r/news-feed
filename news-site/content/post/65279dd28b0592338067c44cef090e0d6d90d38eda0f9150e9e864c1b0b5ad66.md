  <p id="0eGeIz">You can create a great TikTok video by doing nothing more than simply talking to the camera. However, if you want to do something a little fancier or you’re still unsure of your own ability to spruce up your video, you can start with some of the pre-designed templates that come with the app.</p>
<p id="BQ6x4l">Templates make it easy to create a lively, complex video — you just have to drop your own photos and / or videos into the template, and you’re done. (You can, of course, add your own text, sounds, effects, etc. as well.)</p>
<p id="n7EBR7">Here’s how to start using a template:</p>
<ul>
<li id="MD4uvw">Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen to start a new video</li>
<li id="VLNvDe">Select “Templates.” (You’ll find it next to the “Camera” label at the bottom of the screen.)</li>
</ul>
<div><div class="c-image-grid">
<div class="c-image-grid__item">  <figure class="e-image">
