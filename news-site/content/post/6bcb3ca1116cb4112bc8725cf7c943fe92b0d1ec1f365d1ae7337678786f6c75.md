  <p id="ncRzgV">If you can’t get “<a href="https://youtu.be/7_EeCkHs-e0">Bezos I</a>” out of your head, then you’re in good company as a soundtrack to <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81289483"><em>Bo Burnham: Inside</em></a> scored the comedian <a href="https://twitter.com/billboardcharts/status/1406973768568872961">the first Billboard Top 10 appearance of his career.</a> But since the musical comedy special was on Netflix and came out during the pandemic that inspired much of its content, you probably watched it alone. </p>

<p id="HEk5CP">Now fans of the special can see it in a group setting, as Netflix and Iconic Events have teamed up to present the special in theaters nationwide on July 22nd. Tickets are available at many theaters across the country, but you may want to move fast — at the moment there is only one showing per theater at the locations I checked, and some already show that they’re sold out.</p>
