  <p id="ZTVRLW"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo, </em>the paranormal action game from Japanese studio Tango Gameworks, is being delayed to early 2022. Tango Gameworks posted the news <a href="https://twitter.com/playGhostwire/status/1414947726731751443">in a tweet</a>, saying it will show more of the game in the coming months.</p>
<p id="owtb0V">“We want to get the game in your hands as soon as possible so you can experience the unforgettable version of a haunted Tokyo that we’ve been hard at work building. At the same time, we’re also focused on protecting the health of everyone at Tango,” the announcement reads. “Our new release window will give us time to bring the world of <em>Ghostwire</em> to life as we’ve always envisioned it.” The game was previously slated for release in fall of 2021.</p>
