  <p id="Uf8Ys7">Moderna gave its mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine to the first set of volunteers in a clinical trial, the pharmaceutical company <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-phase-12-study-its">announced today</a>. The start of the trial marks the next stage of the company’s work on this type of vaccine technology after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement">overwhelming success</a> of its COVID-19 vaccine, which was built using the same <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons">strategy</a>. </p>
