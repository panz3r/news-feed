  <p id="fJpU8s"><em>Death Stranding: Director’s Cut</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569182/death-stranding-directors-cut-new-features-release-date-ps5">coming to the PS5 on September 24th</a> — but don’t call it a director’s cut, according to director Hideo Kojima (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-12-kojima-disagrees-with-death-stranding-directors-cut-title">spotted by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>).</p>
<p id="JGviEl">“A director’s cut in a movie is an additional edit to a shortened version that was either released reluctantly because the director did not have the right to edit it, or because the running time had to be shortened,” <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1414442896367915015">Kojima explained on Twitter this morning</a>. “In the game, it is not what was cut, but what was additionally produced that was included. Delector’s [sic] Plus? So, in my opinion, I don’t like to call ‘director’s cut’.”</p>
