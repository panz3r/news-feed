  <p id="Hi5U8G">General Motors is dropping wireless smartphone charging from some new SUVs because of the global microchip shortage. Itâ€™s the latest feature to get the axe at the company due to the low supply of semiconductors, as GM has already <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41307/gm-pulls-hd-radio-from-2021-silverado-and-sierra-pickups-over-chip-shortage">pulled HD radio from some models</a>, along with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/41008/gm-drops-auto-stop-start-from-v8-silverados-and-sierras-due-to-chip-shortage">auto start-stop</a> and a fuel management module that made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions">pickup trucks slightly cleaner and more efficient</a>.</p>

But GM tells <em>The Verge</em> that certain 2022 Buick Enclaves, Chevy Traverses, and Cadillac XT5s and XT6s made after August 2nd are also affected. </p>
