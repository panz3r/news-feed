  <p id="OJUBaZ">The deals are thin today, but there are a few that are worth sharing with you. If you already have a Switch or are planning to get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates">the OLED model launching in October</a>, you’ll definitely want to get Hori’s Split Pad Pro controllers. You can get them in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the translucent black colorway (in my opinion, the best option available) for $40 at Amazon</a>, which is $10 off their normal price. These slide in just like Joy-Con controllers but are more accommodating for larger hands than Nintendo’s. They make the Switch less portable, but it might be worth it for you. Unlike Joy-Con, though, these don’t feature rumble, and they only work while connected to the Switch. </p>
