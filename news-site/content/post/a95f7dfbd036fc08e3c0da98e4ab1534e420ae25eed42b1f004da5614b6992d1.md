  <p id="sdjIZw">Blake Masters, a close ally to billionaire Peter Thiel and current Thiel Capital executive, launched a bid for the Arizona Senate Monday. As a Republican, he’ll be seeking to take on Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ). Masters joins a growing pool of Republican candidates, including Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and solar power executive Jim Lamon.</p>
<p id="1zKOPt">On his campaign website, Masters champions a total ban on illegal immigration, calling for the government to use “physical walls, surveillance technology, thousands more border patrol agents, and mandatory E-Verify for employers” along the US-Mexico border. Thiel’s Founder’s Fund invested in the border and military surveillance company Anduril, valuing the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-01/anduril-startup-backed-by-peter-thiel-is-valued-at-1-9-billion?sref=ExbtjcSG">at $1 billion</a>.</p>
