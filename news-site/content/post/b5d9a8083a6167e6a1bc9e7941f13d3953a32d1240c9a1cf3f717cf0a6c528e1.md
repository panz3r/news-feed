  <p id="Kcsy32">A Facebook-backed initiative aiming to let people type by thinking has concluded with new findings published today.</p>
<p id="GXOJ49">Project Steno was a multi-year collaboration between Facebook and the University of California San Francisco’s Chang Lab, aiming to create a system that translates brain activity into words. A new research paper, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027540?query=featured_home">published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em></a>, shows potential for implementing the technology for people with speech impairments.</p>
<p id="eMNDAx">But alongside the research, Facebook made clear it is backing off the idea of a commercial head-mounted brain-reading device, and building out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo">wrist-worn interfaces instead</a>. The new research has no clear applicability for a mass-market tech product, and <a href="https://tech.fb.com/bci-milestone-new-research-from-ucsf-with-support-from-facebook-shows-the-potential-of-brain-computer-interfaces-for-restoring-speech-communication/">in a press release</a>, Facebook...</p>
