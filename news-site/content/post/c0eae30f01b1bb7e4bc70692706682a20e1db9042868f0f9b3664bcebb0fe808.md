  <p id="1VjkiC">A few days ago, Tag Heuer posted a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570322/tag-heuer-nintendo-super-mario-watch-tease-collaboration">teaser for a Super Mario-themed watch</a>. You might have assumed that a Swiss-made mechanical timepiece was in the works, but now the news is out: it’s actually a limited edition version of Tag’s Connected Wear OS smartwatch. </p>
<p id="NduSUi">Tag Heuer seemingly hasn’t released details itself yet — its <a href="https://www.tagheuer.com/us/en/announcement/coming-soon.html">website</a> is still counting down to a July 15th announcement — but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/its-a-me-mario-smartwatch-by-tag-heuer-connected-060037257.html"><em>Engadget</em></a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/this-limited-edition-super-mario-smartwatch-will-run-you-2150/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, and <a href="http://en.worldtempus.com/article/watches/trends-and-style/tag-heuer-teams-up-with-pop-culture-icon-super-mario-30306.html"><em>WorldTempus</em></a> have all posted stories with the device’s key features. The hardware itself appears to be identical beyond some light cosmetic tweaks to the 45mm case, including an M-for-Mario logo on the crown, and it comes with two straps: one with perforated red rubber alongside one with red rubber and black leather.</p>
