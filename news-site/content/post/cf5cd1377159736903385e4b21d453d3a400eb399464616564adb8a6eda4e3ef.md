  <p id="vTJVOB">Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen">a new model of the Switch this week</a> that adds an OLED screen, enhanced speakers, and a much-improved kickstand. One thing it seems the OLED Switch won’t bring, however, is a fix for the Joy-Con drift issues that have plagued Switch owners for years — and frustratingly, Nintendo won’t even confirm that it won’t. A variety of publications including <em>The Verge </em>tried to ask the question, but Nintendo won’t tackle it head-on, despite other helpful answers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k">like how the new Switch won’t have a new CPU</a>.</p>
<p id="uWj6Bs">Switch owners have been reporting Joy-Con drift problems <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">for years</a>, and the problem is bad enough that it’s the subject <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-lawsuits-nintendo-is-facing-over-joy-con-drift">of numerous lawsuits</a> — though Nintendo will unofficially fix controllers experiencing Joy-Con drift <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty">for free</a>,...</p>
