<p>Ars Technica’s Ron Amadeo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/how-the-fbi-weaponized-android-modding-with-anom-devices/">more details</a> on the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/06/the-fbi-created-a-secure-messaging-company-to-roll-up-criminals/">fake phones the FBI seeded amongst criminals</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Two different interfaces would launch depending on what PIN you typed in on the lock screen. PIN one would show a bunch of popular but non-functional apps, like Tinder, Instagram, Facebook, Netflix, and Candy Crush. Presumably, this was meant to fool any third parties checking out your phone.</p>
<p>  A second PIN would enter what was supposed to be the secure section of the phone, showing three apps: a clock, calculator, and the settings. From here, the “calculator” app actually opened a login screen to Anom, which targets were told was a secure, encrypted way to chat. This was basically the smartphone equivalent of a fake book triggering a bookshelf to slide over, revealing a secret passage. It’s so secret, it has to be secure!

<p>I love this story so much. It kind of reminds me of the “secret” games and programs you could install on your graphing calculators back in the day.&#8230;</p>
