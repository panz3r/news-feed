<p>I know you’ve heard it a million times before, so many times that you skim past it when you read it. And you’ll probably do it again this time, but I’ve got to try. I’m looking out for your best interests here.</p>
<p>However much you’re <a href="https://sixcolors.com/tag/backup/">backing up your Mac</a>, you’re probably not backing it up enough.</p>
<p>Last week my friend Antony <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonyJohnston/status/1410979408748421127">lost nearly a week of productivity to a dead drive</a> in his iMac. Fortunately, he was able to recover every one of his files thanks to various backup strategies.</p>
<p>Similar to my <a href="https://sixcolors.com/member/2021/01/raiders-of-the-dead-drive/">Drobo crash of early 2020</a>, Antony’s use of Time Machine and Backblaze allowed him to get up and running with a minimum of pain. It’s an important point that doesn’t get enough attention: you aren’t backing up enough.</p>

(It says automatic backups are off because I’m using <a href="https://tclementdev.com/timemachineeditor/">TimeMachineEditor</a> to schedule them.)</figcaption></figure><p>Start with Time Machine. Apple builds it into every Mac, and thanks to the arrival of APFS and changes in macOS Big Sur, it’s a lot less painful to use than it used to be. Buy a drive that’s bigger than your Mac’s hard drive and attach it to your Mac regularly.&#8230;</p>
