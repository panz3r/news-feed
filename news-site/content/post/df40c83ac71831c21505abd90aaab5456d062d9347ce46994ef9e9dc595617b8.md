  <p id="pUa5Kn"><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s</em> free update optimizing the game for next-generation consoles, which is set to hit later this year, will include DLC “inspired by” the Netflix show, developer CD Projekt Red and Netflix announced at WitcherCon on Friday. </p>
<p id="zFYHGt">Very little was revealed about what the DLC will look like, but we did get a small tease of what you might be able to expect: “So as an example, you might be able to wear Geralt’s armor inspired by the Netflix series,” Philipp Weber, acting lead quest designer at CD Projekt Red, said <a href="https://youtu.be/OMjTMybsZvo?t=6035">during Friday’s WitcherCon stream</a>. More information <a href="https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1413568916920602625">is coming soon</a>.</p>
