The repository is the largest set of COVID-19 records to date, and was built by a team of researchers and data experts last year to help make sense of COVID-19. </p>
<p id="8RCAq3">The study, published in the journal <em>JAMA Network Open</em>, looked at risk factors for severe cases of COVID-19 and traced the progression of the disease over time. The authors<strong> </strong>built machine learning models to predict which hospitalized patients would develop severe disease based on information collected on their first day in a hospital. </p>
