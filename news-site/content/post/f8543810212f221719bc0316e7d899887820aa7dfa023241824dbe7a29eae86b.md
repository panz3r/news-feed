<p>  <strong>Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback</strong>: Mail toolbar should provide single-tap icon for clipboard paste.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Please describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:</strong></p>
<figure class="pull-right"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BF7142E5-B53F-4B83-A42C-DC24891A9B98.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="Icon" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure><p>Mail offers buttons to add photos, take a photo, adjust fonts, scan a document, insert a file, or use Markup — but if you want to paste text from the clipboard you have to find it under a submenu that’s shared with undo/redo.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. If there’s room for esoteric items like “use the camera to scan documents,” why is there no room for pasting text? It’s a task that should not require two taps.</p>
<p>Related: Hiding paste <a href="https://twitter.com/marc_plus/status/1413574149612752896">and cut</a> under an undo/redo submenu makes no sense. They are not related at all. I’d recommend hiding as little as possible under submenus, but if you must, please group like items together.</p>
<p>(Note: You may argue that this is easily solved by invoking the three-figure gesture to paste text. If unknowable gestures are good interface design, I recommend removing all icons and toolbars from iOS and replacing them with an entirely gestural interface. [I do not actually recommend this.] But if you think toolbars are a good idea, because it’s nice to have functions available with a single tap, why hide pasting text in a junk drawer designed for undo and redo?)&#8230;</p>
