  <p id="Req545">On Friday, when I wrote about how a sealed copy of <em>The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda</em> for the NES <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game">sold for an eye-popping $870,000 at auction</a> and set a new record for the most expensive video game ever sold, I wondered which game would be the first to sell for more than a million. Just two days later, I have my answer: a sealed copy of the Nintendo 64 classic <em>Super Mario 64</em> <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/super-mario-64-wata-98-a-sealed-n64-nintendo-1996-usa/a/7261-28137.s">sold for an astonishing $1,560,000</a> at Heritage Auctions on Sunday, smashing the record that had just been claimed by <em>The Legend of Zelda.</em></p>
<p id="gCdACD">Over the past 12 months, the record for the most expensive video game ever has risen dramatically. Hereâ€™s the timeline of the record, as far as I am aware:</p>
<ul>
<li id="Wtexn0">July 10th, 2020: copy of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>sells for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever">$114,000</a>
</li>
<li id="GYSbMX">November 23rd, 2020: copy...</li>
</ul>
