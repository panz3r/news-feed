It’s a tool that I had a need for in my day job for years. The problem it’s solving is a problem that I felt many people had too. But when I talked to people about it, most times it didn’t really click. So I thought “crap, they don’t get it, cause they don’t see it. Once I build it, they’ll get it”.<p>I didn’t spend an awful lot of time on it. And I think the app is ok-ish for an MVP.<p>Now I posted it here and there and sent it to a few people I know, but it doesnt seem good enough.<p>I realize now the importance of having a broad reach. If I was someone like Mike Bostock, with a bunch of followers, I’d just post it to Twitter and voila. Someone said earlier on HN: building an MVP should include a distribution strategy. And I can feel that pain. Now distribution is something I have zero skills at.<p>What should I do? There are a few things I could be doing, like:<p>- get better at marketing, make a video for my target customers<p>- try and build an audience through blogging and things of that nature<p>- go and sell it to customers in real life.<p>- try and find a co founder who would have the time and skills to do these things.<p>- add more features to the MVP that people tell me are missing<p>- create more documentation for the MVP, so that onboarding is smoother.<p>What would have most impact in getting the app in front of people?</p><hr><p>Comments URL: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26734079">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26734079</a></p><p>Points: 166</p><p># Comments: 191</p></div><div class=tags><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Tags</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/tags/hacker-news-frontpage/>hacker-news-frontpage</a></p></div><div class=clearit></div></div></div></main><footer><a href=https://github.com/panz3r>Panz3r</a> 2020 | <a href=https://github.com/panz3r/hugo-vitae>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></body></html>
