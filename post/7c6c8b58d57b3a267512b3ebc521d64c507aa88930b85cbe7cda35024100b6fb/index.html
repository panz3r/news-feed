You’ll also probably need to be on the latest firmware version.</p><p>Second, if you <em>do</em> have Special Offers, you’ll need to pay the $20 to remove it from your device.<sup id=fnref-19423-asknicely><a href=#fn-19423-asknicely class=jetpack-footnote>1</a></sup></p><p>Finally, I had to restart my Kindle for the option to show up in Settings > Device Options, and even then it took a couple of lock-unlock cycles for it to show up on the screen.
